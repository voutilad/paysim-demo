# Modeling 1st & 3rd Party Fraud with PaySim 2.1
Create your own fraud network in your local Neo4j instance and explore a virtual mobile money network!

![](./paysim-2.1.0.png?raw=true)

## Requirements
To build and run this demo, you'll need:
* [Java 11 JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
* [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download) v4.2 (community or enterprise)

### Known Issues ⚠️
Before you get started, keep in mind the following caveats:
  * Large simulations generate a lot of Neo4j write transactions. I've done little tuning of batch sizing, so make sure to allocate at least 2GB of JVM heap space as there's no error handling in the loader currently.
  * You may get `org.neo4j.driver.exceptions.TransientException`s spit out into the console...don't panic and just ignore those for now 😉 it's due to my sloppy coding.
  * There's a `WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred` because of a 3rd party dependency in use

## Building & Running 🛠
This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and should work with your favorite Java IDE (if so desired) or you can just use the provided gradle wrapper scripts. They will download the appropriate version of Gradle for your platform and orchestrate things for you.

### Quick & Dirty with Gradle Run 🏃
If you want to use all the following defaults, this is the easiest way to run the simulation and build the graph.

Assuming:
- bolt uri: `neo4j://localhost:7687`
- neo4j admin user is `neo4j` and password is `password`

On Linux/*BSD/macOS:
```shell script
$ ./gradlew run
```

On Windows:
```shell script
> .\gradlew.bat run
```

### Packaging to Run without Gradle
First, build a distribution.

On Linux/*BSD/macOS:
```shell script
$ ./gradlew distTar
```

On Windows:
```shell script
> .\gradlew.bat distZip
```

In `./build/distributions` you'll find either the `.tar` or `.zip` file. You can unpack the contents wherever you want to "install" the demo app.

```

```

Inside `bin/` you'll find a shell script and batch file for easily running the demo:

```
burritogrande[paysim-demo-0.6.0]$ ./bin/paysim-demo -h
usage: paysim-demo [-h] [--properties PROPERTIES] [--uri URI] [--username USERNAME] [--password PASSWORD] [--tls TLS]
                   [--batchSize BATCHSIZE] [--queueDepth QUEUEDEPTH]

Builds a virtual mobile money network graph in Neo4j

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --properties PROPERTIES
                         PaySim properties file (with paramFiles adjacent in same dir) (default: PaySim.properties)
  --uri URI              Bolt URI to target Neo4j database (default: bolt://localhost:7687)
  --username USERNAME    (default: neo4j)
  --password PASSWORD    (default: password)
  --tls TLS              Ues a TLS Bolt connection? (default: false)
  --batchSize BATCHSIZE  transaction batch size (default: 500)
  --queueDepth QUEUEDEPTH
                         PaySim queue depth (default: 5000)
```
